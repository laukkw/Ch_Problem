# Ch_Problem

✗ The child's problem, in order to use golang to do a small project, started this on the evening of March 31.

This project is inspired by "知乎". 

It will make four calculations for the child, using time as a random number seed, just I don't know how to use glade. 

In order to highlight the strength of golang, 

I will use the texts and English words that I need to climb out of high school junior high school. 

Then show them to you.
